# Pizza

So, Pinocchio's is a popular pizza place in Cambridge. Its menu fits on a single [web page](http://www.pinocchiospizza.net/menu.html) and is pretty easy to grasp once you get the hang of it.

To support an online ordering system we need some way of calculating prices automatically. 

Your job is to design a database with tables that stores all pricing information from Pinocchio's price list. And you are going to write a couple of SQL queries to show that your design works for calculating various prices.

- We provide several products for which prices have to be calculated.
- Student designs database tables for the purpose of having very simple queries.
- Feedback in between. Some kind of target on how simple the queries can become. Or we provide queries.
